# talks

This github repository hosts the slides to my upcoming or old talks.

## How to display talk

Since I based my talk on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and made them headless (i.e. not reliant on npm crap) via a simple `wget -m` invocation you can just `cd` into the talk that interests you and host it with a web-server of your choice.

I recommend: ```python3 -m http.server``` for simplicity or take one from [this list](https://gist.github.com/4thel00z/cab7ea7f4392d2b5631a31797a8479d8)
